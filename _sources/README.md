This [book](https://prob-stat-python.github.io/textbook) covers the main concepts of Probability and Statistics necessary to understand advanced methods in Econometrics, Data Science and Machine Learning. It was designed to provide the foundations for my other book: [Causal Inference with Python](https://causal-methods.github.io/Book
).
